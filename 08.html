                This week was all about research and finding data on social media platforms.
                <br><br>
                Once again, I was back on the partnerships tracker, making sure the stats (particularly from the Redbull partnership) were all up to date. Additionally, I also put together a new tracker with the five most recent creative map launches so that the creative and socials team can properly identify any trends that led to increased player activations on not only the creative maps but also the social media platforms.
                <br><br>
                Following this, I delved into more general social media research, exploring potential video short trends/sounds that could be utilized on the PWR social media channels. As the next Fortnite season draws near, we're eagerly formulating a social plan for its release. With the strong likelihood of a Marvel themed season, our primary strategy for the season launch is to tap into the nostalgia of Season 2 Chapter 4 of Fortnite, which was also Marvel themed.
                <br><br>
                Design-wise, it was pretty simple: I just created some more birthday posts for both Looter and Torsos, which will occur near the end of this month.
