                This week's activities fell into two main categories.
                <br>
                The first was making more graphics for the PWR social media teams. This time, I was more orientated at the in-house Fortnite Creative team, which was making some celebratory posts showing the achievements of the maps (only one has been posted so far). So, I had to match a similar post made in the past and remix it slightly to seem "updated".
                <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">ðŸ˜±5 MILLION PLAYS ðŸ˜±<br><br>Thank you to everyone who&#39;s ran it up on Duo Endless Zone Wars!<br><br>Search PWR in Fortnite to Play ðŸŽ® <a href="https://t.co/ME797gSlVX">pic.twitter.com/ME797gSlVX</a></p>&mdash; PWR Create (@PWRCreate) <a href="https://twitter.com/PWRCreate/status/1808863080857694210?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 4, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
                <br><br>
                My other main task was to update the big partnerships tracker that PWR has. This tracker is a crucial tool for the partnership team, as it keeps track of all the deliverables that sponsors require, and also some of the other trackers that aren't required by the brand, but they have done anyway as it makes sense for the PWR (or creators) brand.
