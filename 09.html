                With less than a month to go, we're starting to reach the endgame for this internship! With that in mind, much of the content reinforces what I've learned throughout this internship.

                With the FNCS globals also starting to approach, there's been some discussion about what direction PWR wants to take, but with the competition still a few weeks away, it's a bit on the backburner.

                Other things to note are that we did a minor design of Torsos' birthday post and that I also got a post for Alex out. Additionally, I got a few meme posts done as well, as the end of the current season of Fortnite is starting to wrap up.
