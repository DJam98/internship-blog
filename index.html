                    This is it. This is the start of this internship with PWR! For the first week, there was little to focus on. This week's primary goals were...</p>

                    It's week two! This week, I started creating content for the PWR social channels. Below are all of the posts I made on the official PWR channels...

                    With the FNCS (Fortnite Championship Series) Semi-Finals approaching, one of this week's biggest focuses was creating a range of posts saying that if the players who were playing for PWR qualified through from the semi-finals made it into the grand finals. This involved...

                    We're really starting to get into the swing of things now! Once again, very much repeating a lot of the tasks that we've been doing. This week, there was a lot of focus on designing many aspects of the...                </p>

                    This week was all about research and finding data on social media platforms. Once again, I was back on the partnerships tracker, making sure the stats (particularly from the Redbull partnership) were all up to...

                    I'm really getting to the end of it now. I spent this week drafting up a few more game plans for the FNCS globals and more meme preparation for the end of the current Fortnite season.

                    Another week, another set of memes to put out into the worldâ€”as well as a few creative map achievements. At the end of the day, it is ultimately about trying to get the most views on the content, isn't it?

                    It's the last week of the internship! This week's focus is on finishing up any previous designs I did and getting a bit more content out since the new season of Fortnite has been released.

                    This was just the final day. It was a day to say bye, but PWR also wanted to have a shoot of all the interns who had been at PWR for the last couple of months, which will be eventually published on their LinkedIn page.
