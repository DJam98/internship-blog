                With Volx joining the PWR roster and qualifying for the FNCS Semi-Finals, we have to go back to the FNCS Qualified graphic and make another set including Volx, but that was an easy task to get done. Other than that, this week was relatively quiet for PWR, so one of my tasks just involved searching through all PWR creators and pros to find some clips that could be interesting to use on the PWR social media channels.
