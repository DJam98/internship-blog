                We're really starting to get into the swing of things now! Once again, very much repeating a lot of the tasks that we've been doing. This week, there was a lot of focus on designing many aspects of the social media platforms. Although, this week was a lot more trial and error with quite a few designs ending up in a state where they just weren't in a state to publish. However, this did lead to one of the best posts that I've made. This post ended up getting over 185,000 impressions, which is a far cry from the usual 10,000-20,000 that the page usually gets!

                I also did a bit more work on the qualified and general FNCS graphics, but two other things I did this week were shadow behind the production team as they filmed Volx's signing skit video, which was a blast to watch.
